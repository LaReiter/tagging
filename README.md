This repository contain supplementary files (plots, scripts, results) relating to the article "Assessing the period of anomalous behaviour of Artic Narwhals (Monodon monoceros) following capture, tagging and release".

The page contains
- Scripts (+ simulated data) used to generate the figures, and small examples.
- Additional plots which did not make it in the final paper
- Results for ODBA

Errata:
- "otherscripts" (in this repository) should be "otherplots"
